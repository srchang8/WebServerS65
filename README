PURPOSE
The purpose of wsng is to provide the basic features of a HTTP server.

FEATURES
wsng provides the following features commonly found in HTTP servers:

- GET returns the contents of a file, including size and timestamp
- HEAD returns metadata for a file, including size and timestamp
- execution of CGI scripts
- passing parameters as QUERY_STRING
- error handling for non-existent files, bad requests etc.

IMPLEMENTATION
We first read the config file and open a server socket. The config file may
contain content type mappings, which are stored in a linked list.

When a request comes in, we start a child process that handles the request.
Each time we start a child process, we check if there are zombie processes 
and reap them if necessary.

The child process parses and executes the request:
- split path and query
- remove '..' from path
- return 404 error if file does not exist
- execute file if its extension is .cgi
- otherwise, set content type according to file extension and return its content
- if file is a directory:
  - if it contains an index.cgi file, execute it and return the result
  - if it contains an index.html file, return its contents
  - otherwise, list directory contents as a HTML page
